\chapter{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}

This chapter evaluates potential legal, social, ethical, and professional issues that may arise during the research process. It concludes by explaining how the research adheres to the British Computing Society's Code of Conduct.

\section{Legal Considerations}

The research utilises two publicly available datasets: CTU13\cite{garcia2014empirical} and CICIDS2017\cite{sharafaldin2018toward}. These datasets are accessible for research purposes and are not subject to legal restrictions. The research does not involve the use of personal data, as CICIDS2017 is a synthetic dataset and CTU13 has excluded passive network flows that could potentially contain sensitive information. By avoiding the use of personal data, the research ensures compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

\section{Ethical \& Social Considerations}

The focus of this research is on evaluating the transferability and generalisation of machine learning models across different datasets. The study does not involve human subjects, and the datasets used are publicly available. Consequently, there are no ethical or social issues associated with this research.

\section{Professional Considerations}

The research findings indicate that the current state of machine learning model transferability across different datasets is limited, which can be problematic for organisations relying on these models for cybersecurity purposes. The study suggests that organisations should exercise caution when deploying machine learning models across different environments, as the models may not generalise well. However, the explainability results provide insights into the reasons behind this limitation, paving the way for future work aimed at improving the transferability of machine learning models.

\section{British Computing Society Code of Conduct}

This research is conducted in accordance with the British Computing Society's Code of Conduct. The study is carried out with integrity and professionalism, and the results are presented accurately and transparently. The research does not involve any ethical or social issues, and the datasets used are publicly available and free from legal restrictions. The findings of the research are presented in a clear and understandable manner, and the limitations of the study are acknowledged.
