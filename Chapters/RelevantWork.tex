\section{Support Vector Machines for Intrusion Detection}
Intrusion detection tasks have extensively utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM). Kabir et al.~\cite{kabir2017network} proposed an SVM-based intrusion detection system and evaluated its performance on the NSL-KDD dataset. They used a genetic algorithm for feature selection to identify the most discriminative features for intrusion detection. The authors also optimized the SVM parameters using grid search to improve the model's performance.

\section{Challenges and Limitations}
Intrusion detection system developers and evaluators frequently employ the CTU13 and CICIDS2017 datasets. Nonetheless, it is necessary to recognize their limitations. Sommer and Paxson~\cite{sommer2010outside} have addressed the challenges of utilizing synthetic datasets for network intrusion detection. They contend that these datasets may only partially capture the intricacy and variety of network traffic and require additional contextual information. Furthermore, the authors stress the necessity of more authentic and comprehensive datasets that consider the operational aspects and deployment hurdles of intrusion detection systems.

Furthermore, Sommer and Paxson~\cite{sommer2010outside} highlight the importance of using representative and unbiased datasets for training machine learning models in network intrusion detection. They discuss the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of network traffic and the constant evolution of attack patterns, which can impact the long-term performance of the trained models. Buczak and Guven~\cite{buczak2015survey} provide a comprehensive survey of machine learning and data mining methods for cyber security intrusion detection. They discuss the considerations and challenges in applying machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection, including selecting appropriate algorithms, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

The choice of machine learning classifier depends on various factors, such as the dataset's characteristics, the nature of the attacks, and the computational resources available. Buczak and Guven~\cite{buczak2015survey} provide a comprehensive survey of machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection. They discuss the strengths and limitations of different classifiers and emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate features, handling imbalanced data, and evaluating the performance of classifiers using relevant metrics.

Comparing the performance of different classifiers on multiple datasets provides valuable insights into their generalization capabilities and transferability. Training classifiers on one dataset and testing them on another helps assess how well the learned patterns and features can be applied to detect intrusions in different network environments. This approach helps understand the robustness and adaptability of the classifiers across various scenarios.
