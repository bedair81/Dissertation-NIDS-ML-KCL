Machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can detect novel cyber threats by learning patterns from network traffic data. This dissertation investigates the transferability of learned patterns across datasets using random forests and support vector machines (SVMs).

\noindent It analyzes flow-based features to uncover characteristics distinguishing malicious and benign traffic, and employs explainable AI techniques to identify relevant features. The findings contribute to developing effective NIDS solutions by providing insights into the transferability of learned patterns, dataset biases, and explainability.
