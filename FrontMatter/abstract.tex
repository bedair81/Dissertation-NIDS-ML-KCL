This dissertation explores the efficacy of machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) in identifying cyber threats through pattern analysis in network traffic data.

\noindent By specifically examining the transferability of patterns between the Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) across different datasets, this dissertation evaluates flow-based features to differentiate between malicious and benign traffic. It also employs explainable AI techniques to pinpoint critical features for threat detection. The insights into the adaptability of learned patterns and the challenges of dataset biases and model explainability contribute to the enhancement of NIDS.\@ The strategies for improving detection accuracy and model transparency offered in this dissertation can significantly bolster cybersecurity defences, making them more robust and effective in the face of evolving cyber threats.
