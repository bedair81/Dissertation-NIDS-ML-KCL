# Dissertation LaTeX Report

This repository contains the LaTeX source for my dissertation titled "Transferability and Explainability of Machine Learning Models for Network Intrusion Detection." This work is being submitted to King's College London as part of the requirements for my 3rd-year project module, 6CCS3PRJ.

The LaTeX template, provided by King's College London, structures the dissertation into comprehensive sections, ensuring adherence to the college's submission guidelines.

## Dissertation Structure

- Relevant Work
- Specification/Design
- Implementation

Each section is designed for detailed exposition on various aspects of the project, from conceptualization to future prospects.
