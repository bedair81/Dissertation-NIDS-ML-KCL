# Dissertation LaTeX Report

This repository hosts the LaTeX source files for my dissertation, "Transferability and Explainability of Machine Learning Models for Network Intrusion Detection," submitted for the 3rd-year project module (6CCS3PRJ) at King's College London.

The provided LaTeX template from King's College London organizes the document into several sections per the institution's submission guidelines.

Each section elaborates on different dimensions of the project, from the initial concept to future directions.
